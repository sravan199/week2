Module :

Module in Node.js is a simple or complex functionality organized in single or multiple JavaScript files which can be reused throughout the Node.js application.
Each module in Node.js has its own context, so it cannot interfere with other modules or pollute global scope. Also, each module can be placed in a separate .js
file under a separate folder.Node.js implements CommonJS modules standard. CommonJS is a group of volunteers who define JavaScript standards for web
server, desktop, and console application.

Node.js Module Types

Node.js includes three types of modules:

	Core Modules
	Local Modules
	Third Party Modules
Core Modules
	Node.js is a light weight framework. The core modules include bare minimum functionalities of Node.js. These core modules are compiled into its 
binary distribution and load automatically when Node.js process starts. However,they  need to be import the core module first in order to use it in application.
